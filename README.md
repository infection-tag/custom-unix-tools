# The Jackhammer for your command line

Your UNIX command line needs more. Let's face it, at its core, we find ourselves constantly repeating the same boring commands over and over again. This repo attempts to keep track of the most useful UNIX tools.

## Some examples

Here are some examples:

### Meta

`meta` tells you all about your current directory. For instance, running meta in an example folder produces:

```sh
$ meta

/------------------------------------------------------------------
 16K	total
/Users/nishantkompella/work/custom-unix-tools
This repo is git initalized.
------------------------------------------------------------------/

```

### new-git

new-git intializes your current desktop folder to be set up for git.

### Many more!

To learn more about the commands you may find, you can simply use `man` (which comes with your command line) to find out about a certain command.

## Setup

To setup, simply open your terminal and type:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/infection-tag/custom-unix-tools
sudo sh custom-unix-tools/src/setup.sh
```
